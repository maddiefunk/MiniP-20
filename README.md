# Module 20 Mini-Project: Film Tracker CI/CD & Testing

In this mini-project, you'll work with a group to add GitHub Actions to a functioning film-tracking application then deploy it to Render. You will work in a feature branch against a `develop` and `main` branch.

The GitHub Actions you will set up should only allow pull requests to the `develop` and `main` branches if your tests are passing. A successful pull request to `main` will also automatically deploy the application to Render.
